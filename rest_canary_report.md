## Updated
- Story 1.1.1: As a developer, I want a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W integrated on the PCB so that I have wireless connectivity and sufficient processing power for flight control
- Story 1.1.2: As a developer, I want dual DRV8833 motor drivers on the PCB so that I can control 4 brushed DC motors independently
- Story 1.1.3: As a developer, I want a GY-91 9-DOF IMU integrated so that I can measure orientation, acceleration, and magnetic heading
- Story 1.1.4: As a developer, I want proper power management with LiPo battery support so that the drone can operate wirelessly
