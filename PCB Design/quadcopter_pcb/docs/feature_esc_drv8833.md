# Feature: ESC Control with DRV8833

## Description
Control the drone's motors using two DRV8833 motor drivers as electronic speed controllers (ESCs). This feature enables precise motor control for flight operations.

## Requirements
- Interface with DRV8833 motor drivers
- Control motor speed and direction
- Integrate motor control with flight algorithms

## Scope
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, DRV8833 motor drivers
- Software: MicroPython
- Communication: GPIO/PWM

## Related Test
See `tests/test_esc_drv8833.py` for validation of motor control functions.
