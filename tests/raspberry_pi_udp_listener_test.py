"""
Raspberry Pi UDP receiver test to verify it sees Android app signals.

Usage:
- Run this on a Raspberry Pi connected to the same Wiâ€‘Fi as the Android phone (or on the Pico AP).
- In the Android app, set IP to the Raspberry Pi's IP address and Port to 8888.
- Start sending from the app; this script will print each CSV packet and reply with "ACK" so the app shows link health.
